Hello inHabitants!

In our perpetual effort to find better ways to keep our community connected, informed, and cared for we've made the decision to retire the [Chef Habitat Discourse Site](https://forums.habitat.sh) and migrate to something we hope will be more useful. We've been discussing the forums and their efficacy for a while but we've finally come to a conclusion. Looking at metrics from all of our communication tools (github, slack, discourse, and the Chef Habitat website) we've found that our community has just not adopted the forum/mailinglist format as a desired communication mechanism.

What does all of this mean? Well, what we absolutely _do not_ want is to pull the plug on a tool that fills a need for the community so instead of simply shuttering the Chef Habitat discourse, we're going to migrate to something more lightweight and centralized. What this looks like in practice is that we will be migrating the Chef Habitat forum/mailing list discussions from forums.habitat.sh over to discourse.chef.io. It won't however, be a direct migration. Instead of having oodles of Chef Habitat related categories we're going to merge all the current Chef Habitat categories down to a single instance and migrate that to a "Chef Habitat" category. Since traffic on the current Chef Habitat discourse is quite light we feel like a single category is probably more than enough (at least initially) to serve as a spot for asynchronous communications.

The goal right now is to make it easier to bubble up any community interactions happening via the forums in a more effective way while also minimizing some of our operational and administrative overhead. With that in mind, we've set up slack integration from this new category to update the "#discourse-habitat" channel in slack as new posts are submitted and recorded a video explaining how to set up the mailing list behaviors of the new discourse server.

This brings us to the most important note. The migration process will _start_ on Monday, December 4th and will be completed on Monday, December 11th. When the migration occurs we will provide a redirect to any hyperlinks directly to the new Discourse instance. As always, thank you for using Chef Habitat and should you feel like following up on this feel free to comment here, or message any of the core team on slack!
