Habitat 0.70.0 Release Notes

We are happy to announce the release of Chef Habitat v0.70.0. We have some new features
and at least one really great bug-fix for our Windows users! We discovered a memory
leak in the versions of the crate we use for printing to stdout on Windows and
correcting that version plugs the leak! You can read more details on that fix [here](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/5921).

As always thank you for using Chef Habitat!
