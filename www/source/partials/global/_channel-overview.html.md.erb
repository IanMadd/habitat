Chef Habitat supports continuous deployment workflows through the use of channels. A channel is a tag for a package that the Supervisors in a service group can subscribe to. Channels are useful in CI/CD scenarios where you want to gate a package before making it the default version of the package that users should consume. You can think of this split as the difference between test and production, or nightly releases versus stable releases of products.
