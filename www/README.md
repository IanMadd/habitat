## How To: Add a Blog Post

  ```
  $ touch source/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-your-blog-post-title.html.md
  ```

* Open up your blog post

  ```
  $ vim source/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-your-blog-post-title.html.md
  ```

* And add these headers

  ```
  ---
  title: You Blog Post Title
  date: YYYY-MM-DD (make sure this matches the date in the file name!)
  author: FirstName LastName
  tags: related_tags (see other posts for examples)
  category: category of post (see other posts for examples)
  classes: body-article
  ---
  ```

* Then add your content below that.

* After adding your content, save and close the file, then open this file

  ```
  $ vim www/data/author_bios.yml
  ```

* If your bio is not already there, add it in this format, then save and close
  the file. Specifically, make the yaml key for your name a lowercased version
  of your name with all spaces removed.

## How-To: Serve Docs Locally

1. Execute the `run` task to build and start the docs server on your local machine

    `make run`

1. The task will contain server output indicating what URL you should load in your browser to preview it

    `== View your site at "http://mylaptop.example.com:4567", "http://192.168.1.101:4567"`

1. You can continue to make changes to the documentation files and Middleman will reload them live
1. Press `Ctrl-C` to terminate the server when you are finished

## How-To: Deploy

1. [Setup your workstation](#setup)
1. Configure your environment

  * AWS_BUCKET - for production deploys, this should be `habitat-www`, for acceptance deploys `habitat-www-acceptance`
  * AWS_DEFAULT_REGION - this should be `us-west-2`
  * AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - your personal AWS account identifier
  * AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - your AWS account's personal access key
  * FASTLY_API_KEY - your Fastly account's personal access key
  * FASTLY_SERVICE_KEY - service identifier for `www.habitat.sh`

  ```
  $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIBJTPWS4EK8L2RXUBZ
  ```

  > Note: values for each of these can be found by logging into your AWS and Fastly control panels.
  > Note: make sure that the AWS credentials you use are for the Habitat AWS account and not the regular Chef AWS account.
